# Erlang Playground of Leonardo Arcari

This repository is a personal place to play around with Erlang during my studying activities. So feel free to look somewhere else, because only incomplete, probabily broken pieces of Erlang code can be found here.

Sorry for stealing you those valuable seconds that took you to go through this useless README.
